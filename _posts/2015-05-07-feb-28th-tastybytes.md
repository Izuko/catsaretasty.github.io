title: 'Feb 28th - #TASTYBYTES!'
---
Our THIRD event in a single month sees us rolling with another whopping five artists showcasing their gems for free,
thanks to the wonders of the Internet! We were lucky enough to host Modulation, Kick the Habit, DJ Braindead, Joe Zay
and The Brig in what turned out to be the craziest event we have held so far. Now enough of the fluff, let's get on to
the meat.

Modulation: the first of our artists for the night, hails from Israel and has been slowly chipping away at the
Electro-House scene since mid 2011. Despite being only 20 years old, his music is already becoming well-known thanks to
its slick producing and some killer basslines. This bare-bones description doesn't give anywhere near enough credit to
this young producer, as it is safe to say we were thoroughly blown away by what we witnessed:

The “Super Electro House All Time Set” that Modulation played for us was full of top class party tunes spanning a whole
variety of different genres. He said himself that he enjoys to work with “many styles, deep house, progressive house,
electro, glitch and even drumstep”, meaning we were constantly left wondering what was next. There were links we could
not have imagined and yet it worked absolutely perfectly thanks to his sheer skill.

We were lucky enough to have an insight into just how much work he puts into these sets. With each transition into a new
tune, Modulation would comment on why that particular track was chosen, with one song in particular being chosen due to
it having a drop that “is probably one of the craziest I ever heard in my life”. Perhaps more touching: when playing his
own song “Groovy Movie”, he discussed how “this song changed my life, and so much stuff happen to me after that i
released it”, we could almost see the smile behind those words.
After hitting us all straight in the feels with some Gemini, Modulation decided to then crank up the speed up to 11 and
from then on, things were a blur of bass and synth. We believe PhonalVogg probably summarized it best in just a

Modulation has made it absolutely clear that he is eager to connect to anyone who enjoys his music and has been kind
enough to provide us with a whole host of links, including his personal Facebook page. We encourage you to have a look
and follow him, as we are sure there is greatness in his future (and we intend to be there). If you fancy lingering in
the past just a little longer, then check out the mix on

Our next set came from the pair who need absolutely no introduction: our great friends Kick The Habit. We have come to
know these two a lot over the past few months and it was our pleasure to have them back with us once again for another
hour of heart-stopping beats in their “Sick Tapes Vol. 2”.

Their set featured a lot of Tastycat staples: Galantis, their own songs “Bitches”, “Work Hard” and “Ten Time Bigger”
mixed with a whole conveyor belt of party hits. The real surprise however came in the form of Aazar's “Masala” which
added an interesting eastern flavour that got all of us bringing out our inner Bollywood.

Kick the Habit never fail to get the crowd worked up and as always our community lapped up the Glitch Hop as if it were
a last meal. We wouldn't have settled for anything less from them. Keep up the habit just a bit longer

Dj Braindead is another well respected artist we have managed to coax into Tastycat. With over 10 years on the scene,
he is now regarded as one of the leading producers in Israel. Following some dabbling in Hip-Hop and other genres,
Braindead soon came full circle and has returned to his love of House, Breakbeat and Dubstep.

The set itself was jam packed with over 50 songs; a mix of old and new, spanning a whole plethora of different genres
- we even had Red Hot Chilli Peppers make an appearance, which went down a storm! Tastycat staples such as Pegboard
Nerds, Zomboy and Far Too Loud featuring of course, but also making room for other, less played artists such as Ruff
Riders, Wildchild and Metrik. We believe that Tastycat should be a place to discover and share interesting music and
we can say that Braindead absolutely accomplished this to the woe of our already stuffed hard drives. Relive it all

Joe Zay also helped us a great deal in this particular mission, mainly thanks to him offering up several of his tunes up
for free and showing off a couple of unfinished works such as “I'll Make You Feel Good” (and by golly did he accomplish
that). Zay's LoL-inspired Glitch-Hop was a white-knuckle attraction that left us screaming (for real) for more.
Thankfully we have the pleasure of being able to offer you the chance to listen to a couple of things for as long as you
wish...check out the following links for delicious, free downloads:

...And finally we rocked things up with The Brig and their “Cyber Mix”, setting things alight with Teminite's
“Highscore”, a real Tastycat classic. Now if that didn't get the blood pumping, then what is to follow just might: a
user by the name of Midax decided to draw our attention to the possibility of a video floating about featuring a very
naked Brig...

...You'll unfortunately have to hunt for this yourselves.

Back to the music and once again we were treated like royalty as we were given the first glympse of “Puppet”, a track
which really will push your eardrums to the limit. We were also gifted with The Brig's remix of “Good Boy” which once
again will blow your mind, so please do consider wearing mind-exploding protection of some sort, before hopping over to

We had Feed Me, Galantis, Kick The Habit...Many MANY big names flew past over the course of the night – not that we had
much time to get hung up on a single tune before the next one picked us up and swept us along down the river. This truly
was a night where self control flew out of the window. Ah, that's a good point...we should consider trying to recover
git from off the ceiling...

Until next time, kittens.
