Friday , 8 pm GMT , the time we usually play latest Monstercat Podcasts! However this time the latest one was late, so we've played Monstercat 021 - Perspective (Vantage Album Mix) instead!  The crowd was surprised but pretty damn positive, voted over 350 Woots and 100+ Grabs ! Have you tuned in when it happened?If not, listen to the mix
