I was born a long, long time a go in soviet Germany. But just as I was half a year old our glorious country fell and got reunited with the peasent, western Germany. When I turned three years old I was taught to be an assassin to remove socialist politicians, with the goal to split Germany and recreate the awesome GDR.

After training for 6 years, it was time for my secret mission. However I failed because I found the mystical beat in the form of EDM. Back then it was distributed by the group called Scooter. Because of that failure we had to escape and in the end moved behind enemy lines.

I can live with my failure, however the only way to deal with it is staying in Tastycat 24/7 and listen to dank tunes.
