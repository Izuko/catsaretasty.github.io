I'm not a charity or an insurance company and I like to spend my time listening to all sorts of music on both plug and my phone. I spend a lot of time playing games on steam so feel free to shoot me a message sometime and maybe we can play together. If you are unsure about me, take a chance ;)  
P.S. Fat32 and I are in love and there is nothing Naomi can do about it. Except maybe join...
