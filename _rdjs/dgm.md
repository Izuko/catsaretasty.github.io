At 18 years old, Darcy Gibbs (aka DGM) is quickly emerging as a prominent name in the underground progressive scene.

Originally from the small town of Bunbury, Western Australia, he moved to Canada in 2008 where he currently lives in Oakville. At the age of 15, he began creating electronic music with a trial version of Cockos REAPER after being inspired by deadmau5's sold out concert at the Rogers Centre in Toronto. He soon switched to Steinberg Cubase; which he currently uses, and just over a year later his debut release "Meridian EP" was released on Swedish label WeRecommendRecords.

Recent works include his collaboration with Vitodito "Wonder" and the anthemic "In My Mind" out on Macarize. With multiple remixes and originals already underway, 2015 is set out to be an extremely productive year for DGM.
