I guess I should put something of a bio up here hmm? 

Well I kinda got dragged onto plug by a forceful person named FAT32 and after a while I was on there 24/7, being a good ol'red headed betch.
That's when I became a bouncer who could terrorize everyone. Ahh good ol' times.

-sigh- 

But nowadays real life caught up to me and I am more busy outside of plug than inside of plug so if you are lucky you'll see me pop on from time to time to be the monster under your bed... that leaves a memory behind!  
So ye watch your back (well your arm) and... be a good boy ;)

And oh ye, the angry looking cat on my picture is what you guys know as a :angrymittens: she's the ruler of us all and has half a mustache. We love her very much though.
