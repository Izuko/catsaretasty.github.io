title: How to reduce lag?
---
I am lagging the whole time, what can I do to reduce this?

* You can reduce the lag by reducing the cap of the avatars. One way to change this is by going to settings, which you can access when you click on your name, choose settings and then adjust the "cap avatars" slider. You can set it anywhere between 1 and 200. A quicker way to reduce this is by using the command “/cap 1”
 
* Another way to reduce lag is by turning off dancing avatars, which you can also turn off in settings.
 
* Enabling video only mode will also help to solve performance issues that you may be experiencing.
