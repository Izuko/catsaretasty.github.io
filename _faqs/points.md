How do I gain XP and PlugPoints and what do they do?

• How to gain XP:

-You gain XP every 5 minutes that you spend on the site, up to a maximum of 6 hours per day. After 6 you will reach your daily XP cap, daily XP caps reset at midnight GMT.
-XP helps you to level up! Leveling will let you unlock more avatars and site features!
 

• How to gain PlugPoints:

-PlugPoints are points that are earned through your activity on the site. Plug points are a currency that you can use to purchase avatars and badges site features that you’ve unlocked with your XP.
-You can also buy a name change with your Plug Points, remember to check out the Extras Shop section, but remember you need to be level 5 to purchase one.
