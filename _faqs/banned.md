title: Banned, now what?

I have been banned from Tastycat and I don't know why. How do I get unbanned?

Staff may ban a user that has:

 * Continuously broken the [room rules](/rules) despite being warned.

 * Has done something serious such as posting a NSFW link into chat.


If you feel you have been wrongly banned by one of our staff, you can send us a message on either [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TastycatPlugdj) or directly through our website [here](/contact).


We will do our best to respond to your ban appeal as soon as we are able to do so!
