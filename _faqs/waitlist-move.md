Why are people getting moved up the waitlist?

Tastybot will add and move users up the list when:

 * Someone has used the !dc command to get their spot on the watilist back after disconnecting.
 
 * Users that have won the hourly lottery and have accepted it by using the !accept command will be added and boosted to position 5 on the waitlist.
 
 * A Resident DJ has requested to be boosted to play a WIP or a new track they have made (this is a privilege that RDJs of the room have).
