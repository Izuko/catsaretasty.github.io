There is one important rule if you want to become staff and that is **DO NOT** ask to become staff.

I have good music and want to become a RDJ, how?

• If you want to become an RDJ show us what you've got by playing your own music. Be careful though that you do not overplay your own music! If a staff member is starting to like your music there is a chance that you will be nominated for RDJ, although it is not only about the music you make it’s also about your behavior within our community. Remember: Rome wasn’t built within a day. Getting RDJ is not an instant achievement, patience is the key.

How do I become a bouncer?

• Our staff team is always on the look-out for helpful and friendly users that have the best interest in our community. Once we see these traits in you and think that you've got what it takes to become a bouncer within our community we will approach you, not the other way around.

How do I become a manager?
