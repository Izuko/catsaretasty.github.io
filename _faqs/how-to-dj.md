title: How can I be the DJ?

I want to be the DJ and play a song I have selected but I don’t know how.


• When we are in joinmode, you can simply type !join into the chat to be added to the joinqueue! The bot will choose a random user from the joinqueue and add them to the waitlist! You will only need to use the command once. Autojoin will not work when there are users in the joinqueue since the waitlist will be locked.
 

• When we are using the regular waitlist system you will need to spam the orange "Join Waitlist" button. A spot on the waitlist will open up after every song so you will need to be quick as there will be lots of users doing the same thing! You may use an autojoiner, however this won't secure you a place on the waitlist; will only increase your chances of getting onto it!
 

• Just remember o be patient if you are waiting to join the waitlist! There are plenty of other users trying to do the same thing as you so it may take a while to join.
