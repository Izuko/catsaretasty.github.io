1. Do not ask for skips. If you do not like a song meh and mute it!
2. Do not ask to be promoted. Ranks are to be earned!
3. If people want to be your friend they will add you to their friends list themselves, do not bother them by asking for it.
4. Do not ask for Gifts, people will gift you if they feel like it.
5. Do not promote or share links for other communities in chat.
6. You can only post promotion links to the artist that you are playing while you are in the DJ booth (max. twice) or when someone personally requests them.
7. Keep your negative attitude and complaints to yourself. Remember to be respectful towards all members of the community. If someone is being rude to you, mention it to a moderator so that they can deal with it.
8. Spamming and trolling is not tolerated in chat.
9. You are not allowed to post NSFW material into chat.

12. You're more than welcome to help out new users in our community, but when it comes to actual moderating, please leave it to the staff team :) Mini-modding is not tolerated.

14. Remember to use common sense in the chat but also have fun!
